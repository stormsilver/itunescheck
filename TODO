* - just a bullet
N - needs to be done for next release

=========================================================================
=       These Must Be Done
=========================================================================
*   customizable display for "classic" view .. for all views?
N   QuickPlay playlist
*   QuickPlay hover
N   QuickPlay window sizing
N   set when the info window shows





=========================================================================
=       These Should Be Done
=========================================================================
*   For CI transitions where the info window is already open, figure out a way to do the animated resizing
*   For CG transitions where the info window is already open... it doesn't look very good
*   more info views ... these also need to be customizable. how on earth?






=========================================================================
=       These Would Be Nice
=========================================================================
*   Position info window intelligently. How do we capture what the user WANTED to do?
    - what if they wanted to put the window on the right side, but it was so long at the time of positioning that the origin
        was on the left side of the screen?
*   Special parse strings on a per-song basis. specifically to pull out the name/artist pair from certain streaming radio stations
    which do non-standard things.
*   a way to ignore certain itunes notifications (because things like Frequence and HotMixRadio send updates frequently)
    - use the above special parse strings to ignore notes if it includes that string
