- When using the "while playing" option, if iTunes is paused, it is possible to hit play at exactly the wrong moment
    (just as the "iTunes is not playing anything" window is fading away). The infoController, being visible when the notifcation
    that iTunes is playing again comes through, will show the appropriate track info and then fade away, even though it should 
    fade up and stay there.
- The find window doesn't display its border correctly on display, it doesn't seem to be antialiased. Going to the preferences and turning
    the draw borders option on and off with the find window open will cause it to redraw correctly.
- Playlist feature of quickplay doesn't play the entire playlist if you select a song that's not the first one - it starts at the selection. It should put the selection at the top of the playlist and then play the rest.
